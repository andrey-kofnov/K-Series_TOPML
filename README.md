This repository contains supplementary material (data and source code) to support the TOPML paper submission titled 'Moment-based Density Elicitation with Applications in Probabilistic Loops.'


##############  DESCRIPTION ################


1) req.txt - requirements-file for python to execute "main.py"
2) main.py - .py-file with all mathematical logic and with benchmarks from Table 1. 
It uses "ort_poly2.py" and "Bivariate_normal_distribution.py"
3) ort_poly2.py - python code to carry our Polynomial chaos expansion
4) "Bivariate_normal_distribution.py" - self-written code to implement bivariate normal distribution
5) S1Dataset.txt - dataset from  Munkhammar et al. [2017]
